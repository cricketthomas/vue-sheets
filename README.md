# Vue Sheets
#### A simple app using Vue.js, Vue-router, Axios and Vue charts.js to read and display data about hacked websites. Styled with Bulma. 
This is a simple application that reads json data, then displays each item in a searchable list, then allows you to view details about each 
data breach and see it on a map. Still working on it.
